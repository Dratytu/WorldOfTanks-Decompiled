# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_royale_progression/scripts/client/battle_royale_progression/gui/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the battle_royale_progression/gui package.
# In Python, __init__.py files are used to initialize a package, making it possible
# for the package to be imported by other modules.

# Since this file is empty, it suggests that the package does not require any
# specific initialization at the moment. However, as the package grows and
# additional modules are added, this file might be used to import necessary
# sub-modules or to set any necessary package-level variables or configurations.

# For more information on Python packages and __init__.py files, please refer to:
# https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages
