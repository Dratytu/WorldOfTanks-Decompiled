# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)

# Embedded file name: scripts/client/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/battle/shared/component_marker/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the component_marker package.
# The purpose of this file is to prevent the package from being recognized as a package by Python,
# which would cause issues when importing modules from this package.

# By creating an empty __init__.py file, we ensure that the component_marker directory is treated
# as a package by Python, allowing us to import its modules using the standard dot notation.

# For example, if there was a module named 'marker.py' in this package,
# we could import it in another Python script like this:
# from gui.Scaleform.daapi.view.battle.shared.component_marker import marker
