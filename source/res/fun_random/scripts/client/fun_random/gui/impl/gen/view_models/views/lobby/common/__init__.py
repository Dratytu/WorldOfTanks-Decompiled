# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: fun_random/scripts/client/fun_random/gui/impl/gen/view_models/views/lobby/common/__init__.py

# This is an empty Python module that is intended to serve as a container for
# view models related to the lobby and common functionality in the fun_random
# package. Currently, there are no view models defined in this module.

# When view models are added to this module, they will typically include
# class definitions that inherit from the `ViewModel` base class and define
# various properties and methods to manage the state and behavior of user
# interface elements.

# By keeping related view models in a separate module like this, it can help
# to organize the code and make it easier to find and reuse view models in
# different parts of the application.
