# This is an empty __init__.py file for the battle_control package within
# the battle_royale/gui/battle_control/controllers directory.
#
# In Python, __init__.py files are used to mark a directory as a package,
# and can contain initialization code for the package. In this case, this
# file does not contain any initialization code, but is required for the
# directory to be recognized as a package.
#
# Any modules or sub-packages within this package should be imported here
# if they are intended to be part of the public API for this package.
