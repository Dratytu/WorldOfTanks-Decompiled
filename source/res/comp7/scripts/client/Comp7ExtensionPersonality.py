# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: comp7/scripts/client/Comp7ExtensionPersonality.py

# This script contains the definition of a Comp7ExtensionPersonality class.
# The class has 5 methods: preInit, init, start, fini, and register.

# Importing the 'registerComp7Scaleform' function from the 'comp7.gui.Scaleform' module.
from comp7.gui.Scaleform import registerComp7Scaleform

# The 'preInit' method is defined as follows:
def preInit():
    # The 'registerComp7Scaleform' function is called to register the Comp7Scaleform.
    # This function is typically used to register Scaleform classes or components.
    registerComp7Scaleform()

# The 'init' method is defined as follows:
def init():
    # The function does not contain any code, so it effectively does nothing.
    # This method is usually used to initialize class variables or perform other
    # setup tasks that are required before the class can be used.
    pass

# The 'start' method is defined as follows:
def start():
    # The function does not contain any code, so it effectively does nothing.
    # This method is usually used to start or trigger the main functionality of the
    # class.
    pass

# The 'fini' method is defined as follows:
def fini():
    # The function does not contain any code, so it effectively does nothing.
    # This method is usually used to clean up resources or perform other tasks that
    # are required before the class is destroyed.
    pass

# It is unclear what the 'register' function is supposed to do, as it is not
# defined in this script.
