# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_modifiers/scripts/common/battle_modifiers_ext/battle_modifier/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the battle_modifier module.
# It serves to mark the directory as a package and allows for the importing
# of submodules within this package.

# The battle_modifier module is part of the battle_modifiers_ext package,
# which is used for implementing various battle modifiers in the game.
# This module does not contain any code by itself, but serves as a container
# for other submodules that implement specific battle modifiers.

# Example usage:
# from battle_modifiers_ext.battle_modifier.some_specific_modifier import SomeSpecificModifier
# modifier = SomeSpecificModifier()
# modifier.apply()

# Note: This code is written in Python 2.7, so it may require modifications
# to be compatible with Python 3.
