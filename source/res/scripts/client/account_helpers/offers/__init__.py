# This is a Python module for the account\_helpers package, specifically for the offers sub-module.
# It does not contain any executable code, but instead provides a namespace for other modules
# and classes related to offers.

# The module is compatible with Python 2.7 and has been decompiled from bytecode.

# The module contains no functions, classes, or variables and serves only as a container
# for related code.
