# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_royale/scripts/client/battle_royale/gui/impl/dialogs/sub_views/__init__.py

# This is a blank file that serves as a placeholder for importing various
# sub-views related to dialogs in the Battle Royale game mode.
# Currently, there are no specific sub-views imported or defined in this file.

# As the project progresses and more dialog sub-views are needed, this file
# will be updated to include the necessary imports and code for those views.

# By keeping these imports and definitions separate from the main dialog
# code, the codebase remains organized and easier to navigate.

# Example usage:
# from battle_royale.gui.impl.dialogs.sub_views import SubView1, SubView2
