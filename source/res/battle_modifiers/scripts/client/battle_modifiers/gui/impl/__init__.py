# battle_modifiers_importer - This Python script is a part of the 'battle_modifiers' module, specifically for the 'gui/impl' package.
# 
# This script does not contain any executable code, but rather serves as a convenient way to import all submodules in the package.
# 
# The 'pass' statement is a placeholder and does not affect the execution of the script. Its presence here indicates that the script is intentionally empty.
# 
# By importing all submodules in this manner, the package's functionality can be easily accessed from other parts of the application.
# However, it's important to note that this approach can potentially lead to issues with circular imports, so care should be taken when structuring the code.
# 
# Example usage:
# from gui.impl.battle_modifiers_importer import *
# 
# Now, all submodules in the 'battle_modifiers' package can be accessed directly.
