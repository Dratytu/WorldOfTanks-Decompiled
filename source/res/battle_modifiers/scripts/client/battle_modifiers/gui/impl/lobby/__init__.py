# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_modifiers/scripts/client/battle_modifiers/gui/impl/lobby/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the lobby package within the
# battle_modifiers/gui/impl directory. Its purpose is to ensure that
# the lobby package is recognized as a package by Python, allowing
# for the import of any modules or sub-packages contained within it.
# This file should not contain any functional code and should remain
# empty, with the exception of any necessary import statements.
