# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_royale_progression/scripts/client/battle_royale_progression/gui/impl/gen/view_models/views/lobby/__init__.py

# This is an empty Python file that serves as a container for view models
# related to the lobby of the Battle Royale progression system in the game.

# By leaving this file empty, the developers are likely using it as a
# placeholder to organize their code in a more structured way. Later on,
# they may add various view models as separate modules, which will allow
# for better code organization and maintainability.

# Currently, this file does not contain any code or functionality, and
# simply serves as a placeholder for future development.
