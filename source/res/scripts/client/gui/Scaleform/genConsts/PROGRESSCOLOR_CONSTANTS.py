# This module, PROGRESSCOLOR_CONSTANTS, defines a class with constant strings
# representing different progress bar colors.

# The class is named PROGRESSCOLOR_CONSTANTS and is in PascalCase, which is a
# common naming convention for classes in Python.
class PROGRESSCOLOR_CONSTANTS(object):

    # Each constant is defined as a string with all lowercase letters and words
    # separated by underscores. This is a common naming convention for constants
    # in Python.
    ORANGE = 'orange'
    GREEN = 'green'
    GRAY = 'gray'

    # By defining these constants as class variables, they can be accessed using
    # the class name, like PROGRESSCOLOR_CONSTANTS.ORANGE, rather than creating
    # an instance of the class. This is a common practice in Python for defining
    # constants.
