# This is a Python module that contains helper functions and classes that have
# been marked as obsolete. The purpose of this module is to keep the code
# organized and to provide a central location for these obsolete helpers.
#
# The module does not contain any functional code, but instead serves as a
# container for the following obsolete helpers:
#
# - None
#
# It is important to note that these helpers are no longer recommended for use
# in new code, and may be removed in a future version of the software.
#
# Example:
# >>> import bwobsolete_helpers
# >>> # The following helper is obsolete and should not be used in new code
# >>> result = bwobsolete_helpers.obsolete_helper()
# >>> # Instead, use the following replacement helper
# >>> result = bwobsolete_helpers.replacement_helper()

pass
