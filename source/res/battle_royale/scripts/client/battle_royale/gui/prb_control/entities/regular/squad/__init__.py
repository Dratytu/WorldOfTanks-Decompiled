# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_royale/scripts/client/battle_royale/gui/prb_control/entities/regular/squad/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the 'battle_royale/scripts/client/battle_royale/gui/prb_control/entities/regular/squad' package.
# It serves as a marker file to indicate that this directory should be treated as a package in Python.

# The 'regular' package contains classes and functions related to the creation and management of squads in the Battle Royale game mode.
# A squad is a group of players who have joined together to play a match as a team.

# The 'squad' package specifically contains classes and functions related to the Squad entity, which represents a single squad.
# The Squad entity contains information about the squad, such as its name, leader, and members.

# This file, __init__.py, is an empty file that is required for Python to recognize this directory as a package.
# It should not contain any code or functionality itself, but is instead used to mark the directory as a package.
