# comp7/scripts/client/comp7/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the comp7 package.
# In Python, __init__.py files are used to mark a directory as a package,
# and can contain initialization code for the package.
# However, in this case, the file is empty, indicating that there is no
# initialization code needed for the comp7 package.

# The comp7 package may contain various modules and sub-packages,
# which can be imported and used in other Python scripts.
# By placing an empty __init__.py file in this directory, we have
# told Python that this directory should be treated as a package,
# and any modules or sub-packages contained within it can be imported
# using the standard dot notation.

# For example, if there was a module named 'mymodule' contained within
# the comp7 package, we could import it in another Python script like this:
#
#     from comp7.mymodule import some_function
#
# This would import the 'some_function' function from the 'mymodule' module,
# which is contained within the comp7 package.
