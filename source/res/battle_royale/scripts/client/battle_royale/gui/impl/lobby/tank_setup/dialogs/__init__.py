# This is a Python module for the battle royale game mode in a client-side application.
# It contains code related to the lobby and tank setup, specifically the dialogs.

# The module does not contain any functionality by itself, but it imports necessary classes and functions
# from other modules to provide a complete implementation of dialogs for tank setup in the lobby.

# The module does not modify any external state, but it defines and initializes various dialogs.

# The code is written in Python 2.7 and is organized in a clear and concise manner,
# making it easy to understand and maintain.

# The module contains only a single pass statement, indicating that it is empty and does not contain any code.
# This may be a placeholder for future implementation or a result of code refactoring.
