# Embedded file name: gui_lootboxes/scripts/client/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the gui_lootboxes.scripts.client package.
# In Python, __init__.py files are used to mark a directory as a package, and
# can contain initialization code for the package. However, in this case, the
# file is empty, indicating that there is no initialization code for this
# package.

# The gui_lootboxes.scripts.client package likely contains scripts related
# to the client-side of a graphical user interface (GUI) for a loot box feature
# in a software application.
