# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_royale/scripts/client/battle_royale/gui/impl/gen/view_models/views/lobby/__init__.py

# This is an empty Python file that serves as a container for view models
# related to the lobby of the Battle Royale game mode. Currently, there are
# no view models defined in this file.

# As the project grows and new view models are added, they can be placed
# here for organization and easy import in other modules.

# By keeping all lobby-related view models in one place, it becomes easier
# to maintain and update the codebase, as well as to understand the
# structure of the lobby views.

# Example usage:
# from battle_royale.gui.impl.gen.view_models.views.lobby.some_view_model import SomeViewModel
