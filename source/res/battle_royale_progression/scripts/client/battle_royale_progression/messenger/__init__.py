# This is the \_\_init__.py file for the battle\_royale\_progression.messenger module.
# It serves as the entry point for this module and should contain any necessary
# imports or initialization code.

# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_royale_progression/scripts/client/battle_royale_progression/messenger/__init__.py
pass

# The 'pass' statement is a placeholder and does nothing. It's used here
# because \_\_init__.py files in Python must contain at least one statement.
# In a real implementation, this file would likely contain import statements
# and/or other initialization code for the battle\_royale\_progression.messenger module.
