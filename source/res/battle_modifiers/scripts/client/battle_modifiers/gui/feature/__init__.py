# This is an empty __init__.py file for the battle_modifiers.gui.feature package.
# Its purpose is to prevent this package from being recognized as a namespace package.
#
# A namespace package is a package that only contains other packages and no modules or executable files.
# In this case, the battle_modifiers.gui.feature package contains modules and should not be treated
# as a namespace package.
#
# For more information on namespace packages, see the following link:
