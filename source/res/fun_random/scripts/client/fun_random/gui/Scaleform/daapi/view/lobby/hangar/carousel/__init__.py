# This script defines the initialization of the fun_random package's
# Scaleform GUI for the lobby hangar carousel view.  The carousel view
# is responsible for displaying a rotating set of customization options
# for the user's vehicle. The carousel view is initialized in this
# script, but the specific components and functionality are defined
# in other modules.
#
# This script is intentionally empty, serving as a placeholder for
# potential future modifications or extensions to the carousel view.
# By keeping this script separate from the implementation, it is
# easier to modify or update the carousel view without affecting
# other parts of the codebase.
