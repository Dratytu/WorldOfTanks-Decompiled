# This is the __init__.py file for the fun_random.gui.feature.models module. This file serves
# as a container for related classes or functions that are part of this module. Any Python
# file placed in the same directory as this file will be considered part of this module and
# can be imported using the standard Python import syntax.
#
# For example, if there is a file called my_class.py in this directory that contains a class
# named MyClass, you can import it into your code with the following syntax:
#
#     from fun_random.gui.feature.models.my_class import MyClass
#
# This will make the MyClass available for use in your code and any other code that imports
# this module.
#
# This particular __init__.py file is empty, which indicates that this module does not contain
# any code of its own. However, this does not mean that the module is not useful or important.
# On the contrary, a well-designed module can help organize your code into logical, reusable
# components that are easier to understand, test, and maintain.
#
# When creating a new module, it's a good practice to include an empty __init__.py file to
# indicate that this directory should be treated as a module. You can then add classes, functions,
# or other modules to this directory as needed, and update the __init__.py file to import
# them into the module.
#
# In summary, this __init__.py file is an important part of the fun_random.gui.feature.models
# module, even though it does not contain any code of its own. By serving as a container for
# related classes and functions, this file helps organize your code and make it more modular,
# reusable, and maintainable.
