# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: fun_random/scripts/client/fun_random/gui/impl/lobby/feature/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the fun_random.gui.impl.lobby.feature package.
# Its purpose is to signal the import system that this directory should be treated
# as a package, and to ensure that any necessary package-level initialization
# is performed.

# In this case, there is no package-level initialization needed, so the file
# is empty. However, it is still important to include a comment explaining
# its purpose, to help maintainers understand the structure of the codebase.
