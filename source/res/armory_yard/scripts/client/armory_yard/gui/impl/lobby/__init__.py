# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: armory_yard/scripts/client/armory_yard/gui/impl/lobby/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the armory_yard.gui.impl.lobby package.
# In Python, __init__.py files are used to initialize a package, and can contain
# valid Python code. However, in this case, the file is empty, which means that
# the package does not contain any initializer code.
#
# The armory_yard.gui.impl.lobby package likely contains modules related to
# the lobby of an armory yard game or application. However, without additional
# context or information, it is difficult to provide a more specific description
# of the package's purpose or functionality.
