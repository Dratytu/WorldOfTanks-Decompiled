# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)

# This script is part of the Armory Yard project, which is a client-side module
# for the World of Tanks game.

# The script does not contain any executable code, but rather defines the
# initialization of the daapi package within the armory_yard.gui module.

# The daapi package provides an interface for displaying various screens
# and windows in the game using the Scaleform framework.

# The __init__.py file is a special Python file that is used to initialize
# a package and make its contents accessible to the import statement.

# In this case, the __init__.py file does not contain any code other than
# the pass statement, which is a placeholder for empty blocks of code.

# This suggests that the actual implementation of the daapi package is
# defined elsewhere, and that this file simply serves to mark the package
s boundary within the armory_yard.gui module.
