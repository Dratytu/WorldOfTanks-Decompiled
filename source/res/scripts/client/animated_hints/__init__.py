# This is a Python script for the animated hints module.
# It does not contain any executable code, but rather serves as a placeholder for future implementation.

# The pass statement is used as a placeholder and is equivalent to a null operation.
# It allows the code to run without any errors, even if no action is taken.

# In this case, the pass statement is used in the global scope, which means it serves as a placeholder for the entire script.
# Once the animated hints functionality is implemented, this script can be expanded with the necessary code.

# The scripts/client/animated_hints directory should contain the implementation for animated hints functionality.
