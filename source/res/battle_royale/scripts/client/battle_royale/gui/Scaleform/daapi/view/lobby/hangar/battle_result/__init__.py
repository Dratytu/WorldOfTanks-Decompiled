# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)

# This is a Python script for a Battle Royale game, specifically for the part of the
# code that handles the display of battle results in the hangar screen.
# The script does not contain any functional code, but rather imports necessary
# modules and classes for the implementation of the battle result view in the hangar.

# Embedded file name: battle_royale/scripts/client/battle_royale/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/lobby/hangar/battle_result/__init__.py
# This line imports any necessary modules or packages that will be used in the
# implementation of the battle result view.
