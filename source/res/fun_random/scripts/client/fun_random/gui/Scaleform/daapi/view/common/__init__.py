# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)

# This is an empty __init__.py file, used to indicate that this directory
# should be treated as a package in Python.
#
# The package name is 'fun_random/scripts/client/fun_random/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/common'.
# This package does not contain any functions, classes, or variables
# directly, but it may contain other modules or sub-packages
# that define functions, classes, or variables used by other parts of the application.
#
# By creating an __init__.py file, we ensure that the directory is recognized as a
# package, and that its contents can be imported using the standard Python import syntax.
