# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_royale/scripts/client/battle_royale/abilities/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the abilities package in the
# battle_royale/scripts/client/battle_royale/abilities directory.
# An empty __init__.py file is necessary for Python to recognize a directory
# as a package, allowing you to import modules from this package using
# the 'from battle_royale.abilities import [module_name]' syntax.

# Since this file does not contain any code, there is no functionality to
# document. However, if any modules are added to this package, they should
# include detailed comments describing their purpose, functionality, and
# usage.

# Example usage:
# from battle_royale.abilities import some_module
# some_module.some_function()
