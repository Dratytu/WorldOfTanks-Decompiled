# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: armory_yard/scripts/client/armory_yard/gui/impl/gen/view_models/__init__.py
# This is an empty __init__.py file, which is used to indicate that this directory
# should be treated as a package in Python. It is common practice to include an
# empty __init__.py file in directories that contain Python modules or sub-packages.
# In this case, the package is "armory_yard.gui.impl.gen.view_models", which likely
# contains various view model classes for use in the Armory Yard application.
