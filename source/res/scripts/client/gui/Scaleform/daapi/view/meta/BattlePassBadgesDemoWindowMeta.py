# This script defines a meta class for the BattlePassBadgesDemoWindow, which is a view in the Scaleform framework.
# The Scaleform framework is used for creating user interfaces in the client application.
# The BattlePassBadgesDemoWindowMeta class inherits from the AbstractWindowView class,
# which provides basic functionality for a window view in the Scaleform framework.

class BattlePassBadgesDemoWindowMeta(AbstractWindowView):
    # The BattlePassBadgesDemoWindowMeta class does not contain any methods or properties,
    # which suggests that it is an abstract class that serves as a template for creating a view.
    # The concrete implementation of this view would likely contain methods and properties
    # that implement the specific functionality and behavior of the BattlePassBadgesDemoWindow.

    pass

# The 'pass' statement in the class body is a placeholder and has no effect.
# It is used when a statement is required syntactically, but the program requires no action at this point.
