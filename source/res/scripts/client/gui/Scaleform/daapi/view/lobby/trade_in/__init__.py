# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: scripts/client/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/lobby/trade_in/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file, which is used to mark this directory as a package
# in Python. It does not contain any code and does not have any functionality on its own.

# The package name is "scripts/client/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/lobby/trade_in".
# This suggests that it is part of a larger application related to the game client,
# and that it contains views related to the lobby and a feature called "trade_in".
