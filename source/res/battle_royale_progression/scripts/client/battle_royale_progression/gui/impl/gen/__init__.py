# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_royale_progression/scripts/client/battle_royale_progression/gui/impl/gen/__init__.py

# This script is part of the Battle Royale progression system for a hypothetical
# multiplayer game. It contains the initialization code for the graphical user
# interface (GUI) components of the progression system, implemented using
# the Gen interface of the WG Python GUI Tools.

# The script does not contain any functional code, but rather serves to
# import and initialize various GUI components and layouts. The Gen interface
# automatically generates the necessary code for creating and managing these
# components based on the definitions provided in this script.

# The specific contents of the script will depend on the layout and design
# of the GUI components for the Battle Royale progression system. However,
# in general, the script will import various GUI modules and classes, and
# define the layout and structure of the GUI using Gen's declarative syntax.

# For example, the script may define various GUI windows, dialogs, and forms,
# as well as the buttons, menus, and other interactive elements within those
# components. It may also define the data bindings and event handlers that
# connect the GUI components to the underlying progression system logic.

# Overall, this script plays a critical role in defining the user experience
# and interface for the Battle Royale progression system, allowing players
# to interact with and track their progress through the game's various
# challenges and rewards.
