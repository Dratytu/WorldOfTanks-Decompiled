# This is an empty __init__.py file for the fun_random.gui.Scaleform.daapi.view.lobby.server_events package.
# It serves to prevent the package from being recognized as a namespace package when it is imported.

# An empty __init__.py file is necessary for any Python package, and it can be used to include any
# package-level logic that needs to be executed upon import. However, in this case, there is no such
# logic required.

# The fun_random.gui.Scaleform.daapi.view.lobby.server_events package contains classes and functions
# related to displaying server events in the lobby of the Fun Random game mode.

# The package is organized as follows:
# 
#     fun_random/
#         scripts/
#             client/
#                 fun_random/
#                     gui/
#                         Scaleform/
#                             daapi/
#                                 view/
#                                     lobby/
#                                         server_events/
#                                             __init__.py
#                                             some_module.py
#                                             another_module.py
#                                             ...
# 
# Each module in this package contains code related to a specific aspect of displaying server events
# in the lobby.

# For example, the `some_module.py` file might contain a class that handles displaying a particular
# type of server event, while the `another_module.py` file might contain functions that retrieve
# data about server events from the game's backend API.

# The code in this package is written in Python 2.7 and uses the Scaleform framework for creating
# user interfaces in the Fun Random game.
