# Embedded file name: gui_lootboxes/scripts/client/gui_lootboxes/messenger/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the gui_lootboxes.messenger package.
# It serves to prevent errors that may arise from attempting to import modules
# from a package that has not been initialized.

# An example of how to use this package might look like:
# from gui_lootboxes.messenger import some_module
# result = some_module.some_function()

# For more information on package initialization in Python, see:
