# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: scripts/client/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/lobby/shared/fitting_select/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file, which is used to indicate that this
# directory should be treated as a package in Python.
#
# In this case, the package is named 'fitting\_select' and is located
# inside the 'shared' directory within the 'gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/lobby'
# hierarchy of the project.
#
# An empty __init__.py file is required for a directory to be recognized
# as a package in Python, and can contain initialization code for the
# package if necessary. However, in this case, no such code is needed.
