# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)

# This is a Python script for the gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/bootcamp directory.
# It does not contain any executable code, but rather serves to import the
# bootcamp module within the daapi view package of the Scaleform GUI framework.

# The pass statement is used as a placeholder, and is equivalent to a "no-op"
# (no operation) in Python. It allows the code to run without throwing any
# errors, even though no code is actually being executed.

# The scripts/client/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/bootcamp/__init__.py file serves
# as an entry point for the bootcamp module within the daapi view package.
# By importing this file, developers can access the various classes and
# functions defined within the bootcamp module.

# This script does not contain any classes, functions, or variables, and is
# solely used for organizational purposes.
