# This is an empty __init__.py file for the 'sub_systems' package within the
# 'fun_random/gui/feature' module. In Python, __init__.py files are used to
# initialize a package, and this file serves the purpose of marking the
# directory as a package.
#
# The 'sub_systems' package is intended to contain various sub-systems related
# to the 'fun_random' feature and its graphical user interface (GUI). However,
# this file does not contain any code and is currently empty.
#
# When sub-systems are added to this package, they should be organized into
# separate modules and included in this package directory. Each sub-system
# module should have its own __init__.py file to initialize the module and
# provide any necessary documentation or metadata.
#
# For example, a sub-system related to randomizing game events might be
# implemented in a module named 'event_randomizer', while a sub-system for
# generating random loot boxes might be implemented in a module named
# 'loot_box_randomizer'. Each of these modules would have its own
# __init__.py file, which would provide documentation and metadata for the
# sub-system.
#
# By organizing the code in this way, we can ensure that the 'fun_random'
# feature is modular, maintainable, and well-documented, making it easier for
# other developers to understand and contribute to the codebase.
