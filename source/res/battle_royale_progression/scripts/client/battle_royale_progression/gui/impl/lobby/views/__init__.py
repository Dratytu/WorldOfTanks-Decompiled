# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_royale_progression/scripts/client/battle_royale_progression/gui/impl/lobby/views/__init__.py

# This script defines the initialization file for the lobby views in the Battle Royale progression module.
# Currently, it does not contain any code, as the specific view components are likely defined in separate modules.
# However, this file serves as an entry point for importing all lobby view-related modules in the Battle Royale progression system.

# The 'pass' statement is a placeholder and does nothing when executed. It is used here to avoid raising a SyntaxError for an empty suite.
# In a fully implemented version of this script, the 'pass' statement would be replaced with actual code defining lobby view components.
