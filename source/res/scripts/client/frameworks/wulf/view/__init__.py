# This is the initialization file for the wulf view framework.

# The file does not contain any executable code, but rather serves as a placeholder
# for importing modules related to the view component of the wulf framework.

# By keeping the imports in a separate file, it helps to keep the codebase organized
# and makes it easier to manage dependencies.

# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: scripts/client/frameworks/wulf/view/__init__.py
