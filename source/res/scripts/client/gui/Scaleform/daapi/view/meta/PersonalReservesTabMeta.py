# PersonalReservesTabMeta.py
# This file is a part of the gui.Scaleform.framework.entities package.
# It contains the PersonalReservesTabMeta class, which is an adaptation of
# InjectComponentAdaptor for personal reserves tab related functionality.
#
# The class does not contain any implemented methods, as it is intended to
# be inherited and extended by other classes to provide specific personal
# reserves tab features.
#
# InjectComponentAdaptor is a base class that provides an easy way to
# inject components into the class. This is useful when working with
# the Starfall framework, which relies on dependency injection to
# manage components and their interactions.
#
# The PersonalReservesTabMeta class is designed to be a part of the
# scaleform-based user interface, and it does not contain any business
# logic. Instead, it is focused on managing and organizing UI components
# related to personal reserves in the game.
