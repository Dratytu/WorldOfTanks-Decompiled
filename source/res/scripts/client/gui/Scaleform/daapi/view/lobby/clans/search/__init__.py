# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: scripts/client/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/lobby/clans/search/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the clan search module in the
# Scaleform GUI of the client. The purpose of this file is to serve
# as a placeholder and ensure that the directory is treated as a
# package in Python.

# The clan search module is likely responsible for providing
# functionality related to searching for clans within the game.
# However, based on this file alone, it's impossible to say for
# sure what specific features this module provides.

# It's worth noting that this file only contains a pass statement,
# which is a null operation in Python. This means that there is
# currently no code in this file that is being executed.

# If you're looking to add functionality to this module, you'll
# want to add some actual code below this comment. When doing so,
# be sure to include clear and concise comments that explain what
# each piece of code is doing and why. This will help ensure that
# your code is easy to understand and maintain for yourself and
# other developers who may work on this project in the future.
