# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_royale_progression/scripts/client/battle_royale_progression/gui/impl/gen/view_models/views/lobby/views/progression/__init__.py

# This script defines the view models for the lobby progression views in the
# Battle Royale game mode. Currently, this file does not contain any view
# model classes, as it only serves as a placeholder for importing related
# modules.

# The modules that are imported in this file are likely to contain view
# model classes that are used to display progression-related information in
# the lobby. These view models may include data about player levels, rewards,
# challenges, and other aspects of the Battle Royale progression system.

# By keeping the view models for the lobby progression views in a separate
# module, it becomes easier to manage and maintain the codebase. It also
# allows for better organization and separation of concerns, as all the
# progression-related view models are grouped together in a single place.
