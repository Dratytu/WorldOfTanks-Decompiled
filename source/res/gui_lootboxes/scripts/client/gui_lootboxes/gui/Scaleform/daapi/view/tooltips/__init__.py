# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: gui_lootboxes/scripts/client/gui_lootboxes/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/tooltips/__init__.py

# This script defines the base module for tooltips in the GUI Lootboxes project.
# It does not contain any concrete tooltip implementations, but instead provides
# a foundation upon which tooltips can be built.

# The module is implemented as a Python package, with a single __init__.py file
# that serves to initialize the module and make its contents available for
# import.

# The module does not contain any code beyond the initial import statements,
# which bring in any necessary dependencies for the tooltip system.
