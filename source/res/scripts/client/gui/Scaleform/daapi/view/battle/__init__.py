# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: scripts/client/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/battle/__init__.py

# This script defines the base module for all Scaleform battle views in the
# gui.daapi package. Currently, it doesn't contain any code, but it serves
# as a convenient place to import all battle views.
#
# By keeping all battle views under a single module, we can easily
# organize and manage them. This can be especially useful in large
# projects with many different views and components.
#
# Note that this module does not contain any view-related logic or
# functionality. Instead, it simply provides a centralized location
# for importing and organizing battle views.
