# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_royale/scripts/client/battle_royale/gui/impl/lobby/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the battle_royale.gui.impl.lobby package.
# Its purpose is to signal to the Python interpreter that this directory should be
# treated as a package, and to ensure that the package's __init__.py file is
# executed when the package is imported.

# The battle_royale.gui.impl.lobby package contains modules related to the
# lobby screen for the Battle Royale game mode. The lobby screen is where
# players can customize their loadouts, view game rules, and join matches.

# Currently, this package does not contain any modules or functionality.
# Future development may include modules for displaying lobby information,
# handling player input, and managing game sessions.

# For more information on the Battle Royale game mode and its associated
# lobby screen, see the game design documentation and project roadmap.

# Note: This file should not be modified, as it is automatically generated by
# the build system. Any changes made to this file will be overwritten.
