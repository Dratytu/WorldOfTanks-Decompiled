# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)

# This script is a part of the battle_royale module and is located in the
# scripts/client/battle_royale/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/ directory.

# The purpose of this script is not immediately clear from the code itself,
# as it only contains a single "pass" statement. However, based on the file
# name and location, it is likely that this script is intended to be a
`init`.py file for a package of view-related code in the battle_royale game mode.

# The "pass" statement is a placeholder and does not affect the behavior of
# the script. It is often used as a reminder that additional code is needed in
# the future.
