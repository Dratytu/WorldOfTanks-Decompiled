# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)

# This is a Python script for a module named '__init__' in the 'gui_lootboxes/scripts/client/gui_lootboxes/gui/impl/lobby/gui_lootboxes/tooltips' package.

# The module does not contain any code, and it appears to be empty.

# This could be a placeholder for future implementation, or it might be that the code has been removed for some reason.

# In any case, it is important to keep this module in the codebase if it is being used as a placeholder,
# or if it is required for the proper functioning of the application.

# If the module is not needed, it is recommended to delete it to avoid confusion and maintain code clarity.
