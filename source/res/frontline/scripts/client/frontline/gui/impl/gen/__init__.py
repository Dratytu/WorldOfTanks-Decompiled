# frontline/scripts/client/frontline/gui/impl/gen/__init__.py
#
# This is an empty Python file that serves as a placeholder for generated code
# in the frontline.gui.impl.gen package. The actual code in this package is
# generated automatically and should not be modified manually.
#
# The purpose of this file is to prevent circular imports that can occur
# when using relative imports in a package with generated code. By importing
# from this file instead of directly from the generated module, we can avoid
# these circular imports and ensure that the code runs smoothly.
