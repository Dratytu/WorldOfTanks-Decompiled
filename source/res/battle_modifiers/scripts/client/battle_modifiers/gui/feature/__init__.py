# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_modifiers/scripts/client/battle_modifiers/gui/feature/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the battle_modifiers.gui.feature package.
# It serves to prevent the package from being recognized as a namespace package.

# A namespace package is a package that only contains other packages and no modules or executable files.
# In this case, the battle_modifiers.gui.feature package contains modules and should not be treated
# as a namespace package.

# For more information on namespace packages, see the following link:
