# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: fun_random/scripts/client/fun_random/gui/impl/lobby/platoon/view/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the fun\_random/gui/impl/lobby/platoon/view directory.
# In Python, __init__.py files are used to initialize a directory as a package, and can also contain
# initialization code for the package. However, in this case, the file is empty.

# The fun\_random package is likely related to a specific feature or functionality within the larger
# software application. By organizing code into packages and directories, developers can better
# manage the complexity of their codebase and make it easier for other developers to understand
# and contribute to the code.

# The gui/impl/lobby/platoon/view directory likely contains code related to the user interface (UI)
# for a platoon-related feature in the lobby of the software application.

# The view directory often contains code related to the presentation layer of the application,
# which is responsible for rendering the UI and handling user input.

# Overall, this empty __init__.py file serves as a placeholder and organizer for the platoon/view
# package, and does not contain any functional code itself.
