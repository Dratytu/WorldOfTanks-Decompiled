# armory_yard/scripts/client/armory_yard/gui/impl/__init__.py

# This is an empty Python file that serves as an entry point for the
# graphical user interface (GUI) implementation of the Armory Yard
# application.
#
# By importing this file, the various modules and components that make
# up the GUI implementation will be imported and made available for
# use. This allows for a more organized and modular codebase, as it
# separates the GUI implementation from the other components of the
# application.
#
# As this is an empty file, there is no code or functionality present
# here. However, it is an important part of the overall structure of
# the Armory Yard application.
