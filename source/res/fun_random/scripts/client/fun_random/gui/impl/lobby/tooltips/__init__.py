# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)

# This is a Python script for the fun\_random module, specifically for the
# lobby/tooltips directory. The script does not contain any executable code,
# but rather is a placeholder for future tooltip implementation.

# Embedded file name: fun_random/scripts/client/fun_random/gui/impl/lobby/tooltips.py

pass  # No code is currently present in this script. Once tooltips are
     # implemented, this is where the code would be added.
