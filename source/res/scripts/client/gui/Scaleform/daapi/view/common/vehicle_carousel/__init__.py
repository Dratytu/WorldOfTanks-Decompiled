# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)

# This is the entry point for the vehicle carousel module.
# The vehicle carousel is a user interface component that allows users to browse and select vehicles.

# Embedded file name: scripts/client/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/common/vehicle_carousel/__init__.py

# The vehicle carousel module does not contain any code at the moment, but it serves as a container for
# related files and classes.

# When the module is populated with classes and functions, this is where they will be imported and organized.

# For example, a VehicleCarouselView class could be defined here to handle the logic and rendering of the
# vehicle carousel. This class would contain methods for adding and removing vehicles, handling user
# input, and updating the carousel's appearance.

# Additionally, utility functions for working with the vehicle carousel could be defined here. These
# functions might handle tasks such as formatting vehicle data for display, calculating the position of
# vehicles within the carousel, or managing the carousel's scrolling behavior.

# By organizing related code into this module, we can improve the overall structure and maintainability
# of the project.
