# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)

# This is the initializer script for a set of views related to WotPlus in the lobby.
# It does not contain any functionality itself, but rather imports and initializes
# various modules and components related to WotPlus.
#
# These views are likely part of the user interface for the World of Tanks game,
# and are built using the Scaleform framework.
#
# The script only includes a single pass statement, which indicates that there
# is no functionality or logic contained within this script.

# Embedded file name: scripts/client/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/lobby/wot_plus/__init__.py
