# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: scripts/client/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/lobby/image_view/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the image_view package in the
# daapi.view.lobby module of the client's GUI.
# The purpose of this file is to serve as a placeholder and enable the
# creation of a package in Python.

# The image_view package is likely responsible for handling the display
# of various images within the game's lobby, such as user profile pictures,
# clan logos, or in-game item previews. However, based on the contents of
# this file, it appears that there are no classes or functions defined here.
# Any functionality related to image display would likely be implemented
# in separate modules or scripts within this package.
