# frontline/scripts/client/__init__.py

# This is an empty Python file that serves as the entry point for the 'frontline'
# package's 'scripts/client' module.
#
# Python scripts generally do not require an explicit `__init__.py` file, but
# having one can be useful for organizing and documenting a module's structure.
#
# In this case, the 'scripts/client' module is likely to contain various scripts
# related to the client-side of the 'frontline' application.
