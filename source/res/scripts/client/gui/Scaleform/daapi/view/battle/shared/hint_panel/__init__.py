# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)

# Embedded file name: scripts/client/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/battle/shared/hint_panel/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file, which is used to indicate that this directory
# should be treated as a package in Python. In this case, the package is
# 'scripts/client/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/battle/shared/hint_panel'.
# An __init__.py file can also contain initialization code for the package,
# but in this case there is none.
