# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_modifiers/scripts/client/battle_modifiers/gui/impl/gen/view_models/views/__init__.py

# This script is the initialization file for a module that contains view models for the battle modifiers feature.
# View models are used to manage the data and logic for user interface elements in the application.
# This file does not contain any concrete view models, but rather serves as a placeholder to organize the
# view models into a coherent package.

# The module is organized in a hierarchical structure, with subdirectories for different categories of view models.
# For example, there may be subdirectories for view models related to specific features, such as damage modifiers
# or vehicle customization.

# Each subdirectory contains a separate __init__.py file, which serves to initialize the view models in that
# directory. This allows for a modular and organized approach to managing the view models in the application.

# The use of view models in this way provides several benefits, including:
# - Improved separation of concerns between the user interface and the underlying data and logic
# - Increased reusability and modularity of UI components
# - Simplified data binding and synchronization between the UI and the application state

# Overall, this script plays an important role in organizing and managing the view models for the battle modifiers feature.
