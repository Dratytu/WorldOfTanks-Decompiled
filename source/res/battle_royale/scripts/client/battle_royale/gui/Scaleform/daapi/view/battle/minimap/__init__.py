# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)

# Embedded file name: battle_royale/scripts/client/battle_royale/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/battle/minimap/__init__.py

# This script defines the initialization of the minimap for the Battle Royale mode in the game.
# The minimap is an essential feature in any battle game, providing players with a visual representation
# of the game map and the locations of teammates, enemies, and other important objects.

# The script does not contain any code, and it serves as a placeholder for future implementation.
# Once implemented, the script will likely include functions and methods for rendering the minimap,
# updating the map based on the player's movement and actions, and displaying relevant information to the player.

# The use of the 'pass' statement in the script is a placeholder, allowing the code to run without any errors
# until the actual implementation is added.

# The script is part of the 'battle_royale' module, which contains all the code specific to the Battle Royale mode.
# The 'gui' and 'Scaleform' packages indicate that the script uses the Scaleform framework for rendering the user interface.

# The 'daapi' module is a part of the game's distributed architecture, allowing for communication between different game components.
# The 'view' package contains all the code related to the game's user interface, and the 'battle' package is specific to the battle mode.
