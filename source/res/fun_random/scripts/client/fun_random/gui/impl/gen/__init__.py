# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: fun_random/scripts/client/fun_random/gui/impl/gen/__init__.py

# This is an empty Python file that serves as a placeholder for generated code.
# It is likely that this file was created by a code generator tool,
# such as the ones used to create boilerplate code for user interfaces.

# The file contains a single pass statement, which is used as a placeholder
# and has no effect on the execution of the program.

# If you are modifying this file manually, it is important to be aware
# that any changes you make will be overwritten the next time the code is generated.

# Instead, you should make any necessary modifications in the code generator
# configuration files or in the code that calls the generator.

# For more information on code generation and how it is used in this project,
# please consult the relevant documentation or contact the project maintainers.
