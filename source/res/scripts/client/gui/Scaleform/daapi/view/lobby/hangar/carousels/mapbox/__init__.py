# This is an empty __init__.py file, which is used to mark this directory as a package
# in Python. It does not contain any code and serves only to ensure that the directory
# is recognized as a package by Python's import system.

# The gui.Scaleform.daapi.view.lobby.hangar.carousels.mapbox package contains code
# related to the Mapbox carousel in the game's hangar lobby. However, there does not
# appear to be any code in this particular file.
