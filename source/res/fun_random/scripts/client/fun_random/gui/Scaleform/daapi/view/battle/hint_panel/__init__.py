# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: fun_random/scripts/client/fun_random/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/battle/hint_panel/__init__.py

# This script defines the initialization of the hint panel module in the fun_random
# game's GUI, implemented using the Scaleform technology and the daapi module.
# The script does not contain any code, and its purpose is not clear without
# additional context.

# The hint panel is a user interface element that provides helpful hints and
# tips to the player during battles. It is implemented using the Scaleform
# technology, which allows for the creation of rich, dynamic user interfaces
# that can be rendered using Adobe Flash.

# The daapi module is a part of the game's backend infrastructure, which
# provides access to various game services and data. The hint panel module
# uses the daapi module to interact with the game's backend and retrieve
# the necessary data for displaying hints and tips to the player.

# The script imports no external modules or functions, and does not contain
# any classes or functions. It only defines the initialization of the hint
# panel module, which suggests that the actual implementation of the hint
# panel functionality is located in other modules or files.
