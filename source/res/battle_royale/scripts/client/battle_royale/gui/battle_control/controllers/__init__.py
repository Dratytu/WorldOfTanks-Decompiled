# This is an empty __init__.py file for the battle_control package,
# located in the battle_royale/gui/battle_control/controllers directory.
#
# In Python, __init__.py files are used to mark a directory as a package,
# and can contain initialization code for the package. This particular
# __init__.py file does not contain any initialization code, but is
# required for the directory to be recognized as a package.
#
# The purpose of this package is to contain all of the controller code
# for the battle control feature of the larger battle royale game.
# Controllers are responsible for handling user input and managing
# interactions between different parts of the application.
#
# Any modules or sub-packages within this package that are intended
# to be part of the public API for this package should be imported here.
# However, in this case, no modules or sub-packages are being imported
# directly in this file.
