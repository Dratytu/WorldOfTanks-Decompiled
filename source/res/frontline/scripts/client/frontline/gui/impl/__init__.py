# frontline/scripts/client/frontline/gui/impl/__init__.py
#
# This is an empty Python file that serves as the initialization point for
# the frontline.gui.impl module in the client scripts of the Frontline game.
#
# The purpose of this file is to provide a location for importing and
# organizing all of the various implementation files that make up the
# graphical user interface (GUI) of the Frontline game. By importing all
# of these files into a single module, it becomes easier to manage and
# access the various GUI components that make up the game.
#
# Because this file is currently empty, there is no functionality or code
# to document at this time. However, as the frontline.gui.impl module grows
// and develops, this file will serve as an important entry point for
// understanding and navigating the various GUI components of the game.
