# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_royale_progression/scripts/client/battle_royale_progression/gui/impl/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the 'battle_royale_progression/gui/impl' package.
# In Python, __init__.py files are used to initialize a package and can contain valid Python code.
# However, in this case, the file is empty, which means that the package is not adding any
# additional functionality or behavior when it is imported.

# The purpose of this file is simply to mark the directory as a package, allowing it to be
# imported using a dot notation. For example, if this file is located at
# 'battle_royale_progression/scripts/client/battle_royale_progression/gui/impl/__init__.py',
# then the package can be imported using the following code:
#
#     from battle_royale_progression.gui.impl import some_module
#
# Where 'some_module' is a module contained within the 'battle_royale_progression/gui/impl'
# package.
