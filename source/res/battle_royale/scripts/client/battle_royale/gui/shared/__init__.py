# In Python, a directory is considered a package if it contains an `__init__.py` file. This file can be empty, but its presence is required to treat the directory as a package.

# In this case, the `__init__.py` file is located in the 'battle_royale/gui/shared' directory, which is a package that contains various modules and sub-packages related to the graphical user interface (GUI) of a battle royale game.
# 
# When this file is imported or loaded, any modules or sub-packages contained within the 'battle_royale.gui.shared' package will also be imported and available for use.
# 
# This file does not contain any code or functionality itself, but it plays a crucial role in organizing and structuring the codebase of the 'battle_royale.gui.shared' package.
