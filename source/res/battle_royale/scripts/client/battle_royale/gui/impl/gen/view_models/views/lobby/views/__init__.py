# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_royale/scripts/client/battle_royale/gui/impl/gen/view_models/views/lobby/views/__init__.py

# This is an empty Python module that serves as a container for view models
# related to the lobby and its various views in the Battle Royale mode of a
# hypothetical game. Currently, there are no view models defined in this module.

# When view models are added to this module, they will likely include
# information about the state of various elements in the lobby UI, such as
# player status, available game modes, and in-game purchases. View models
# are typically used to mediate between the UI and the underlying game
# logic, allowing for a clear separation of concerns and easier testing.

# Example usage:
# from battle_royale.gui.impl.gen.view_models.views.lobby.views import some_view_model
# view_model = some_view_model()
# view_model.some_attribute = some_value
# some_view.set_view_model(view_model)
