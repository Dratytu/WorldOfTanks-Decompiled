# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: gui_lootboxes/scripts/client/gui_lootboxes/gui/storage_context/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the gui_lootboxes.gui.storage_context package.
# It serves to mark the directory as a package and can be used to include any
# initialization code that should be executed when the package is imported.
# In this case, there is no initialization code, and the package is simply used
# to organize related modules and sub-packages.
