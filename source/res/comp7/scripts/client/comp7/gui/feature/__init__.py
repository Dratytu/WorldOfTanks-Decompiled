# comp7/scripts/client/comp7/gui/feature/__init__.py
#
# This is an empty __init__.py file for the 'feature' package within the 'comp7/gui' module.
# Its purpose is to mark the directory as a Python package, allowing it to be imported as a
# namespace in other Python scripts. Since this file does not contain any code, there is
# nothing to comment on directly within this script.
#
# However, it is important to note that the 'feature' package is likely to contain various
# features related to the graphical user interface (GUI) of the 'comp7' application.
# These features might include new widgets, dialogs, or other visual elements that enhance
# the user experience.
#
# By keeping these features organized within a separate package, the code becomes more
# modular, easier to maintain, and simpler to understand for other developers working on
# the project.
#
# For more information on Python packages and __init__.py files, please refer to the official
# Python documentation:
