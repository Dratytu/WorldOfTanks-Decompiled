# This script is the initialization file for the Scaleform DAAPI (Dynamic Actionscript API)
# for the Battle Royale game mode. The DAAPI is a set of interfaces and classes that
# provide the communication between the client and the server for the game.
#
# The script does not contain any implemented functions, but rather sets up the
# necessary imports and namespaces for the DAAPI.
