# This is a Python script that is part of the battle_royale module,
# specifically in the scripts/client/battle_royale/gui/impl/gen directory.

# The script does not contain any executable code, but instead is used for
# generating view models for the Battle Royale game mode.

# The script contains a single pass statement, which is used as a placeholder
# and has no effect when the script is executed.

# The purpose of this script is to import all view models for the Battle Royale
# game mode, which are generated based on .py files located in the
# battle_royale/gui/impl/gen/view_models directory.

# By importing all view models in this way, they become available for use in
# other parts of the codebase, without the need to import them individually.

# It is important to note that this script does not contain any business logic,
# but simply serves as a container for the generated view models.
