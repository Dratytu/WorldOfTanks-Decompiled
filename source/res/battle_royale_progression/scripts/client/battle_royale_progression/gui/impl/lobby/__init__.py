# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_royale_progression/scripts/client/battle_royale_progression/gui/impl/lobby/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the lobby package within the
# battle_royale_progression/gui/impl directory.
#
# In Python, __init__.py files are used to initialize a package. In this case,
# this file is likely used to ensure that the lobby directory is recognized
# as a package by the Python interpreter.
#
# Since this file is empty, it does not contain any code or functionality.
# However, it is still important for maintaining the package structure and
# organization of the project.
