# The InfluenceZone class is a subclass of BigWorld.Entity, which is used to represent
# an entity in the game world. This class is likely used to define a zone in the game
# where player influence is tracked or measured.
class InfluenceZone(BigWorld.Entity):
    pass

# The 'pass' keyword is used as a placeholder when a statement is required syntactically,
# but you do not want any command or code to execute. In this case, it is used since
# the InfluenceZone class does not have any methods or attributes defined at this point.
