# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)

# This is an empty __init__.py file, used to mark this directory as a package in Python.
# It does not contain any code and does not have any functionality on its own.
# Its sole purpose is to enable the import of modules and sub-packages contained within
# this directory using the "from gui.Scaleform.daapi.view.lobby.hof import <module>"
# syntax.

# The __init__.py file is crucial for properly organizing and importing code within
# a Python package. It allows for modular and scalable codebases, and is a best practice
# when structuring Python projects.
