# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)

# Embedded file name: scripts/client/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/battle/shared/status_notifications/__init__.py

# This module defines the shared status notifications for battle views in the
# Scaleform DAAPI framework. Status notifications are messages displayed to
# the player during a battle to provide important information or updates.

# The module does not contain any functions or classes, but rather serves as
# a container for importing and organizing the various status notifications
# used in battle views.

# Each status notification is defined in a separate module, and is
# imported here for ease of use. For example, the 'ready' status notification
# is defined in the 'ready.py' module, and is imported with the line:
#    from . import ready

# By importing all status notifications in this way, battle views can easily
# access the notifications they need without having to remember the specific
# module for each notification.
