# This script defines a single class 'MapBoxEntryPointMeta' which is a subclass of 'InjectComponentAdaptor'.
# The purpose of this class is to act as a meta class for a Scaleform view in the context of a game
# client, specifically for the MapBox component.
#
# Inheriting from 'InjectComponentAdaptor' allows this meta class to automatically inject
# dependencies and components required by the Scaleform view.
#
# The class is currently empty, suggesting that additional methods and properties will be
# defined in a derived class to implement the desired functionality for the MapBox component.

class MapBoxEntryPointMeta(InjectComponentAdaptor):
    # The class inherits from 'InjectComponentAdaptor' and does not provide any additional
    # methods or properties, making it a minimal meta class for the MapBox component.
    pass
