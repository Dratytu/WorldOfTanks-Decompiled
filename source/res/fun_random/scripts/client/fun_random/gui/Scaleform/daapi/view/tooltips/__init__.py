# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: fun_random/scripts/client/fun_random/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/tooltips.py

# This module contains the implementation for various tooltips used in the
# fun_random/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view.

# The module does not contain any code itself, but serves to organize and
# encapsulate tooltip-related code in a single location.

# By keeping the tooltip code separate from the main view code, we can
# improve the readability and maintainability of the codebase.

# Additionally, this modular approach allows for easier customization and
# extension of tooltips in the future.
