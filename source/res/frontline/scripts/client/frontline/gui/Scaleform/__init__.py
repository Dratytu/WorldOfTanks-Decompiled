# frontline/scripts/client/frontline/gui/Scaleform/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the frontline.gui.Scaleform package.
# Its purpose is to signal that this directory should be treated as a package
# in Python, and to allow for any necessary package-level initialization.
#
# In this particular case, there are no additional modules or sub-packages
# within frontline.gui.Scaleform, so this file is empty. However, if there
# were additional modules or sub-packages, they could be imported here
# to make them easily accessible to users of the frontline.gui.Scaleform
# package.
