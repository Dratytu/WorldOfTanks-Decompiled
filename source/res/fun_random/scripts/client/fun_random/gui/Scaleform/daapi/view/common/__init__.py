# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: fun_random/scripts/client/fun_random/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/common/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file, which is used to indicate that this directory
# should be treated as a package in Python.
#
# In this particular case, the package is 'fun_random/scripts/client/fun_random/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/common'.
# There are no functions or classes defined in this file.
#
# However, the package may contain other modules or sub-packages, which could define
# functions, classes, or variables that are used by other parts of the application.
#
# By creating an __init__.py file, we ensure that the directory is recognized as a
# package, and that its contents can be imported using the standard Python import syntax.
