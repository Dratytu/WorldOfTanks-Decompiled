# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_royale/scripts/client/battle_royale/gui/battle_control/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the battle_royale.gui.battle_control module.
# It serves the purpose of marking this directory as a package in Python, allowing
# other modules to import its contents.

# The battle_control module is likely responsible for handling various aspects
# of the game's battle control system in the context of the battle royale mode.
# However, without additional information or contents in this file, it is difficult
# to provide a more specific description of its functionality.

# If you are a developer working on this module, you may want to consider adding
# more modules and scripts to this package as needed to implement the desired
# functionality. Be sure to include clear and informative code comments for any
# new modules or scripts you add.

# For more information on Python packages and modules, you can refer to the official
# Python documentation:
