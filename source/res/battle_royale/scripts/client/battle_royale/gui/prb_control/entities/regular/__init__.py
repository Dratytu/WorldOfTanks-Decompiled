# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_royale/scripts/client/battle_royale/gui/prb_control/entities/regular/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the 'regular' entity module within
# the 'battle_royale/gui/prb_control' package. This module will contain
# classes and functions related to the creation and management of
# regular Player vs. Environment (PvE) battles in the Battle Royale game mode.

# Currently, this file does not contain any code and only serves to ensure
# that the 'regular' entity package is recognized as a Python package.

# As this module is developed further, it may include classes such as
# 'BattleRoyaleRegularBattle', which would manage the creation and
# execution of regular battles in the Battle Royale game mode.

# Additionally, this module may include functions for handling player
# invitations, team creation, and other aspects of the PvE battle system.

# By keeping these classes and functions organized within the 'regular'
# entity package, we can ensure that the code remains modular,
# maintainable, and easy to understand for other developers.
