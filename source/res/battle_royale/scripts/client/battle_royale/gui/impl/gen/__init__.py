# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_royale/scripts/client/battle_royale/gui/impl/gen/__init__.py

# This script is an empty __init__.py file, which is a special file used in Python
# to indicate that a directory should be treated as a package. In this case,
# the package is "battle_royale.gui.impl.gen".
#
# An empty __init__.py file is required for a directory to be recognized as a
# package, and it can be used to include any initialization code that should
# be run when the package is imported. However, in this case, there is no
# initialization code, and the file is empty.

# The name of the file suggests that it may be part of a larger project or
# framework related to a "battle royale" game mode. The "gui" and "impl"
# components of the package name suggest that this code is related to the
# graphical user interface (GUI) implementation for this game mode.

# The "gen" component of the package name may indicate that the code in this
# package is generated automatically, rather than being written manually.
# This is a common convention in large software projects, where code
# generation can help to automate repetitive tasks and reduce the potential
# for errors.

# Overall, this script is a simple but important component of the larger
# project or framework, and its purpose is to ensure that the "battle_royale"
# "gui" "impl" package is recognized as a valid Python package.
