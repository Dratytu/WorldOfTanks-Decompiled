# frontline/scripts/client/frontline/gui/impl/gen/view_models/views/__init__.py
#
# This module is an empty init file for the 'frontline.gui.impl.gen.view_models.views' package.
# It serves the purpose of allowing the package to be importable as a namespace, while not
# containing any actual code or functionality.
#
# The 'views' package contains view models for the Frontline lobby, which are used to define
# the data and logic for each lobby screen. View models are a key part of the MVVM (Model-View-
# ViewModel) architectural pattern, which is used to separate the user interface from the
# underlying data and logic.
#
# By keeping the user interface and data logic separate, view models make it easier to test,
# maintain, and reuse code. They also make it easier to create user interfaces that are more
# responsive, dynamic, and adaptable to different screen sizes and user inputs.
#
# This init file is intentionally left blank, as it is not necessary to include any code or
# functionality in this file.
