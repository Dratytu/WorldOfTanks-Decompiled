# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: frontline/scripts/client/frontline/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/__init__.py

# This script defines the entry point for the Frontline GUI views in the
# Scaleform DAAPI module. It does not contain any concrete view classes,
# but rather sets up the necessary imports and module structure.

# The frontline/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/ directory will contain
# various view components specific to the Frontline mode of the game.

# The __init__.py file is an empty placeholder that allows the
# frontline/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/ directory to be treated as a
# package, enabling the import of its submodules using the
# "from frontline.gui.Scaleform.daapi.view import <module>" syntax.

# The "pass" statement at the end of the script is a placeholder and
# has no effect. It is used when a statement is required syntactically,
# but no action is needed.
