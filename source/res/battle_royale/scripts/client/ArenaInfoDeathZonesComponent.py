# This is a Python 3.7 script with no explicitly defined functions or classes.

# The first two lines import the sys and typing modules from the Python standard library.
# The sys module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
# The typing module provides additional tools for working with types in Python, such as type hints and type checking.
import sys
import typing

# There are no explicitly defined functions or classes in this script.
# Instead, the script likely consists of a series of statements that are executed sequentially when the script is run.
# Without more context, it's difficult to say exactly what these statements do, but here are some general comments that might apply:

# Any variables defined at the top level of the script will be available to all subsequent code in the script.
# The sys module provides access to the command line arguments passed to the script when it was run.
# The typing module can be used to specify the expected types of function arguments and return values, which can help with code readability and maintainability.

# Without more information about what this script is intended to do, it's difficult to provide more specific comments.
# However, the comments above should provide some general context for understanding the script's structure and purpose.
