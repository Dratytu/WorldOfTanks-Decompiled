# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: armory_yard/scripts/client/armory_yard/gui/impl/gen/__init__.py

# This script is an empty file that serves as a placeholder for generated code
# in the 'armory_yard.gui.impl.gen' package.

# Generated code, such as UI scripts, will be added to this file automatically
# during the build process.

# It is not recommended to modify this file manually, as any changes made here
# may be overwritten during the build process.

# If you need to customize the generated code, consider creating a new file
# in a different location and importing the necessary modules from the
# 'armory_yard.gui.impl.gen' package.
