# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: scripts/client/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/lobby/server_events/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the server_events package in the
# gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/lobby module.
#
# The purpose of this file is to serve as an entry point for the package,
# providing a namespace for any modules or sub-packages within it.
#
# In this case, the server_events package is used for implementing
# server event-related views in the game's lobby.
#
# However, since this file is empty, there are currently no views or
# functionality provided by this package.
