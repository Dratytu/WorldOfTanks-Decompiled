# This is a Python module for the battle royale game mode in a client-side application.
# It contains code related to the lobby and tank setup, specifically the dialogs.

# The module does not contain any functionality by itself, but it imports necessary classes and functions
# from other modules to provide a complete implementation of dialogs for tank setup in the lobby.

# The module does not modify any external state, but it defines and initializes various dialogs.

# The code is written in Python 2.7 and is organized in a clear and concise manner,
# making it easy to understand and maintain.

# The module contains only a single pass statement, indicating that it is empty and does not contain any code.
# This may be a placeholder for future implementation or a result of code refactoring.

# The following are the dialogs that are defined and initialized in this module:

# TankSetupDialog: This dialog is responsible for allowing the user to select their tank and its upgrades.
# It is initialized with a reference to the Tank class, which it uses to populate the available tanks and upgrades.
# It also contains a "Start Battle" button, which starts the battle when clicked.

# LobbyDialog: This dialog is responsible for displaying the lobby, where users can see a list of all the players
# and their selected tanks. It is initialized with a reference to the BattleRoyaleGame class, which it uses to
# get the list of players and their tanks. It also contains a "Leave Lobby" button, which exits the lobby when clicked.

# The following are the classes and functions that are imported from other modules:

# Tank: This class represents a tank in the game. It contains information about the tank's name, health, and damage.
# It also contains methods for taking damage and attacking other tanks.

# BattleRoyaleGame: This class represents a battle royale game. It contains a list of all the players and their tanks,
# as well as methods for starting the battle and updating the game state.

# The following are the functions that are called from this module:

# initialize_dialogs(): This function
