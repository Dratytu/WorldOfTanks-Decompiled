# This is a Python module for the fun\_random package, specifically for the scripts/client/fun_random/gui/impl/lobby/common directory.

# The module does not contain any code at the moment, as indicated by the pass statement.

# The pass statement is a placeholder and is used when a statement is required syntactically, but you do not want any command or code to execute.

# In this case, the pass statement is used because the module is empty and the user wants to create a placeholder for future implementation.

# As the module is part of the lobby/common directory, it is likely that this module will contain code related to common functionality for the lobby screen.

# However, without any further information, it is difficult to provide a more specific comment.
