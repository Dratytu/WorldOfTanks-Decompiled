# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)

# Embedded file name: scripts/client/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/battle/shared/prebattle_timers/__init__.py

# This is an empty file that serves as a placeholder for the prebattle_timers module.
# The module is intended to provide functionality related to displaying and managing timers
# during the pre-battle countdown phase in a battle.
#
# However, the current version of the file does not contain any code.
# It only contains a pass statement, which allows the file to be imported without raising an error.
#
# If the prebattle_timers module is to be developed further, this file should be populated
# with relevant classes, functions, and methods that implement the desired functionality.
#
# For example, the module could include a PrebattleTimers class that manages the display
# of timers for various events such as the countdown to the start of the battle,
# the countdown to the end of the vehicle selection phase, and the countdown to the end of the pre-battle phase.
#
# The class could provide methods for starting, pausing, and resetting the timers,
# as well as for updating the timer display and handling timer expiration events.
#
# The module could also include utility functions for converting time durations
# to a human-readable format and for scheduling timer updates at regular intervals.
#
# Overall, the prebattle_timers module should provide a clear and concise API
# for managing timers during the pre-battle phase of a battle,
# making it easier for developers to implement and maintain the user interface
# for this critical phase of the game.
