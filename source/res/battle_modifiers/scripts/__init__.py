# This is the entry point for the battle modifiers module.
# The purpose of this module is to contain all code related to battle modifiers.

# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_modifiers/scripts/__init__.py

# This empty script serves as a placeholder for the battle modifiers module.
# As the module grows in complexity, this file will serve as a central location
# for importing all necessary scripts related to battle modifiers.

# For now, this file contains only a single "pass" statement, which serves
# as a placeholder and does nothing when executed.
