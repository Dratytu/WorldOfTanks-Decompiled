# This is the __init__.py file for the fun_random.gui.feature.models module.
# This file is empty, indicating that this module does not contain any code of its own,
# but is instead intended to serve as a container for related classes or functions.
# Any Python file placed in the same directory as this file will be considered part
# of this module, and can be imported using the standard Python import syntax.
#
# For example, to import a class called MyClass from a file called my_class.py,
# you would use the following syntax:
#
#     from fun_random.gui.feature.models.my_class import MyClass
#
# This will make the MyClass available for use in your code, and any other code
# that imports this module.
