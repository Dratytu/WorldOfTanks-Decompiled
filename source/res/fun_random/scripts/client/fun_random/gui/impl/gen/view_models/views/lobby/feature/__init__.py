# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: fun_random/scripts/client/fun_random/gui/impl/gen/view_models/views/lobby/feature/__init__.py

# This is an empty Python module that serves as a placeholder for
# organizing view models related to lobby features in the fun_random module.
# Currently, there are no view models implemented in this module.

# As the project grows and more view models are added, they can be organized
# into sub-modules within the 'fun_random/gui/impl/gen/view_models/views/lobby/feature/'
# directory, and then imported and used in this module as needed.

# By keeping related view models organized in this way, it can help make the code
# easier to navigate and maintain over time.

# Example usage:
# from fun_random.gui.impl.gen.view_models.views.lobby.feature.some_view_model import SomeViewModel
