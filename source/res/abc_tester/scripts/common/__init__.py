# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: abc_tester/scripts/common/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file, which is used to mark this directory as a
# package in Python. When a directory contains an __init__.py file, it is
# considered a package and can be imported as a module.
#
# In this particular case, this __init__.py file is located in the
# abc_tester/scripts/common directory, which means that the common directory
# is a package within the abc_tester/scripts module.
#
# By leaving this file empty, we are indicating that there are no specific
# initialization steps required for this package. However, we could also use
# this file to import specific modules or functions from this package, making
# them available for import when the package is imported as a whole.
