# Its purpose is to signal to Python that this directory should be treated as a package,
# allowing it to import modules and sub-packages using dotted notation.

# Since this file does not contain any code, it will not have any direct impact on the
# behavior of the application. However, it is an essential part of the package's
# organization and structure.

# By including this comment, other developers can quickly understand the purpose of
# this file and its role within the larger codebase.
