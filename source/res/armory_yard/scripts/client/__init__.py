# armory_yard/scripts/client/__init__.py
# 
# This is an empty Python script that serves as the entry point for the 'client' module of the 'armory_yard' package.
# It does not contain any executable code, but it is required to be present for the package to be properly structured.
# 
# The 'client' module may contain various scripts and modules that are used to implement the client-side logic of the application.
# 
# The use of the 'pass' statement in this script indicates that there is no code to execute in this module.
# It is a placeholder that allows the script to run without raising a syntax error.
# 
# For more information on Python packages and modules, please refer to the official Python documentation.
