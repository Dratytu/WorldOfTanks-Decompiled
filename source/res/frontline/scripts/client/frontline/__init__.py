# frontline/scripts/client/frontline/__init__.py
#
# This is an empty Python file that serves as the entry point for the 'frontline'
# module within the 'scripts/client' package. Since there is no code present in
# this file, it does not have any functionality on its own. However, it provides
# a clear organizational structure for the codebase and allows for future
# expansion of the 'frontline' module.
#
# The 'frontline' module may contain various classes, functions, and utilities
# related to the game mode of the same name. By keeping this code separate from
# other parts of the application, we can better manage dependencies and make it
# easier to maintain and test.
#
# As this module grows, it is important to keep the code well-organized and
# documented. Clear and concise comments should be added to all functions and
# classes to explain their purpose and behavior. This will help other developers
# understand the code more easily and reduce the likelihood of bugs and other
# issues.
#
# Example usage:
#   from frontline.scripts.client import frontline
#
#   # Use a function or class from the 'frontline' module
#   frontline.do_something()
#
