# This is a Python script that contains view models for the battle royale game mode in a hypothetical game.
# The script does not contain any executable code, but rather defines view models using the `pass` statement.
# View models are used in the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern to separate the user interface from the business logic.
# Each view model is defined in its own module, which is imported in this script.
# This approach allows for better organization and maintainability of the code.

# The `__init__.py` file is used to mark a directory as a Python package, and it can also contain executable code.
# In this case, the file does not contain any code, as indicated by the `pass` statement.

# The `battle_royale` package contains scripts related to the battle royale game mode.
# The `gui` module contains scripts related to the game's user interface.
# The `impl` module contains implementation details for the user interface.
# The `gen` module contains generated code, which is typically created by a code generator tool.
# The `view_models` module contains view models for the battle royale game mode.

# The script does not contain any functions, classes, or variables, as it only serves to import other modules.
