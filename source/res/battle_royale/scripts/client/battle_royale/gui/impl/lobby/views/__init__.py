# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_royale/scripts/client/battle_royale/gui/impl/lobby/views/__init__.py

# This is an empty __init__.py file for the 'battle_royale/gui/impl/lobby/views' package.
# It serves the purpose of preventing namespace collisions when the package is imported.

# An empty __init__.py file is a common convention used in Python packages to make them importable as a single entity.
# In this case, it allows the 'battle_royale/gui/impl/lobby/views' package to be imported using a single line,
# such as 'from battle_royale.gui.impl.lobby.views import SomeClass'.

# Without this file, importing classes or modules from this package would require specifying the full path,
# such as 'from battle_royale.scripts.client.battle_royale.gui.impl.lobby.views.some_module import SomeClass'.
