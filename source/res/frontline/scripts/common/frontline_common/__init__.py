# frontline/scripts/common/frontline_common/__init__.py
# 
# This is an empty Python file that serves as the entry point for the 'frontline\_common' module.
# It does not contain any code itself, but rather provides a location for importing and organizing
# other modules and functions that are used in common across various parts of the Frontline application.
# By keeping this code in a separate module, we can reduce duplication and improve maintainability.
#
# As this file is currently empty, there is no functionality to document. However, any functions or
# modules imported and used here should be documented in their own files.
