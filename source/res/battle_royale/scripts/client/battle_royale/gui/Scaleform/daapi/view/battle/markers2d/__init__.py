# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)

# Embedded file name: battle_royale/scripts/client/battle_royale/gui/Scaleform/daapi/view/battle/markers2d/__init__.py

# This script defines the base module for 2D markers in the Battle Royale mode of the game.
# It does not contain any specific marker implementations, but rather sets up the necessary
# framework for creating and managing markers.

# The module is written in Python 2.7 and uses the decompiled bytecode format.

# Note that this module does not contain any code other than the pass statement,
# which serves as a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual implementation.
