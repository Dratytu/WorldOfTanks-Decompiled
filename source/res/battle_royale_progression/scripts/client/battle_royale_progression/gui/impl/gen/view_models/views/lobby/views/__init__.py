# Python bytecode 2.7 (decompiled from Python 2.7)
# Embedded file name: battle_royale_progression/scripts/client/battle_royale_progression/gui/impl/gen/view_models/views/lobby/views/__init__.py

# This script defines the view models for the lobby views in the Battle Royale progression system.
# It does not contain any concrete implementation, but rather serves as a blueprint for generating
# the view models at runtime.
#
# All view models in this script are defined within the 'battle_royale_progression.gui.impl.gen.view_models.views.lobby.views'
# namespace, and are implemented as Python classes.
#
# Each view model class is responsible for defining the properties and methods that correspond
# to the elements of the user interface that the view model represents.
#
# Example usage:
#   from battle_royale_progression.gui.impl.gen.view_models.views.lobby.views import SomeViewModel
#
#   view_model = SomeViewModel()
#   # The view model can now be used to populate the view with data, or to respond to user input.
